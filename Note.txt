About variable

name = "ram shrestha"
a = 5
_ = 6
my_name = "ram"     (name is snake case) (for variable name)
myName = "ram"     (name is camel case) (for class name)
MyName = "ram"     (name is pascal case) (for method name)
they are correct for variable

4 = 5
+ = 50
int = 10 (sentence of keyword)
my name = "ram" (about space. we can't use space in variable)
they are not correct for variable

About data type

1.number: int, float , complex          #int=123 ,float=123.5 and complex=
2.string          #things like number ,word or alphabet in ""
3.list          #changeable and ordered ,allow duplicates ,list can have different data types and represented [] square bracket
4.tuple()unchangeable
5.dictionary{}/key: value/index not applied
6.set{}unique/index not applied
7.bool          #true or false
8.none          #none

primitive data types in the language, which are integers, floats, booleans and strings
which means one variable store only one data

others are non primitive data types

1.1-int
age =2024
print(type(age))
print(dir(age))

a =5+6j
print("real",a.real)
print("image",a.imag)

they are int type

1.2-float
a =5.123 (float)
b =5
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
<class 'float'>
<class 'int'>

1.3-complex
